.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Me is a lightweight and secure socks5 proxy. It is a port of the original
shadowsocks created by clowwindy. \*(Me is written in pure C and takes advantage
of \fBlibev\fP to achieve both high performance and low resource consumption.
.PP
\*(Me consists of five components. \*(Lo(1) works as a standard socks5 proxy
on local machines to proxy TCP traffic. For more information, check out
\fBshadowsocks-libev\fR(8).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver_host\fP
Set the server's hostname or IP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIserver_port\fP
Set the server's port number.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocal_port\fP
Set the local port number.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpassword\fP
Set the password. The server and the client should use the same password.
.TP
.B \-m \fIencrypt_method\fP
Set the cipher.

\*(Me accepts 18 different ciphers: table, rc4, rc4-md5, aes-128-cfb,
aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, camellia-128-cfb, camellia-192-cfb,
camellia-256-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb, idea-cfb, rc2-cfb, seed-cfb, salsa20,
chacha20 and chacha20-ietf. The default cipher is \fItable\fP.

If built with PolarSSL or custom OpenSSL libraries, some of these ciphers may
not work.
.TP
.B \-a \fIuser_name\fP
Run as a specific user.
.TP
.B \-f \fIpid_file\fP
Start shadowsocks as a daemon with specific pid file.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout\fP
Set the socket timeout in seconds. The default value is 60.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig_file\fP
Use a configuration file.
.TP
.B \-n \fInumber\fP
Specify max number of open files.

Only avaliable on Linux.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterface\fP
Send traffic through specific network interface.

For example, there are three interfaces in your device, which is lo (127.0.0.1),
eth0 (192.168.0.1) and eth1 (192.168.0.2). Meanwhile, you configure \*(Lo to
listen on 0.0.0.0:8388 and bind to eth1. That results the traffic go out through
eth1, but not lo nor eth0. This option is useful to control traffic in
multi-interface environment.
.TP
.B \-b \fIlocal_address\fP
Specify local address to bind.
.TP
.B \-u
Enable UDP relay.
.TP
.B \-A
Enable onetime authentication.
.TP
.B \--fast-open
Enable TCP fast open.

Only available with Linux kernel > 3.7.0.
.TP
.B \--acl \fIacl_config\fP
Enable ACL (Access Control List) and specify config file.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Print help message.

.SH EXAMPLE
\*(Lo(1) can be started from command line and run in foreground. Here is an
example:

    # Start ss-local with given parameters
    ss-local -s example.com -p 12345 -l 1080 -k foobar -m aes-256-cfb
