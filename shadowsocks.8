.SH NAME
shadowsocks-libev \- a lightweight secured scoks5 proxy 

.SH SYNOPSIS
\*(Lo|\*(Re|\*(Se
    \-s server_host     \-p server_port    
    \-l local_port      \-k password    
    \-m encrypt_method  \-f pid_file
    \-t timeout         \-c config_file

.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Me is a lightweight secured socks5 proxy. It is a port of 
the original shadowsocks created by clowwindy. \*(Me is written in pure
C and uses \fBlibev\fP to provide a both high performance and low resource 
consumption socks5 proxy for users that need a secured tunnel to visit the
internet freely and privately.
.PP
\*(Me consists of three components. One is \*(Se that runs on a remote server
to provide secured tunnel service. \*(Lo and \*(Re are clients that run on your
local machines for proxying all your TCP traffic.
.PP
While \*(Lo can be used as a standard socks5 proxy, \*(Re works as a transparent 
proxy and should be used with the kernel's NAT function. For more information,
check the example section.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver_host\fP
Set the shadowsocks server host.
.TP
.B \-p \fIserver_port\fP
Set the shadowsocks server port.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocal_port\fP
Listen on the local port.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpassword\fP
Set the shadowsocks password. The server and the client should use the same
password.
.TP
.B \-m \fIencrypt_method\fP
Set the shadowsocks encryption method. Currently, shadowsocks accepts several
encryption methods: table, rc4, aes-128-cfb, aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, 
camellia-128-cfb, camellia-192-cfb, camellia-256-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb,
idea-cfb, rc2-cfb and seed-cfb. The default method is \fItable\fP. 
.TP
.B \-f \fIpid_file\fP
Start shadowsocks as a daemon with a specific pid file.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout\fP
Set the socket timeout in secondes. The default value is 10.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig_file\fP
Use a configuration file.

.SH EXAMPLE
\*(Re needs to be used with the NAT function. Here is an example:

    # Create new chain
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -N SHADOWSOCKS

    # Ignore your shadowsocks server's addresses
    # It's very IMPORTANT, just be careful.
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 123.123.123.123 -j RETURN

    # Ignore LANs and any other addresses you'd like to bypass the proxy
    # See Wikipedia and RFC5735 for full list of reserved networks.
    # See ashi009/bestroutetb for a highly optimized CHN route list.
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 0.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 169.254.0.0/16 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 224.0.0.0/4 -j RETURN
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 240.0.0.0/4 -j RETURN

    # Anything else should be redirected to shadowsocks's local port
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345

    # Apply the rules
    root@Wrt:~# iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j SHADOWSOCKS

    # Start the shadowsocks-redir
    root@Wrt:~# ss-redir -c /etc/config/shadowsocks.json -f /var/run/shadowsocks.pid
